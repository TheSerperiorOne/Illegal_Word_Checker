Throughout (1) the Odyssey, Homer places a huge (2) amount of significance on (49) the concept of cleverness, or 'Metis', by portraying the most memorable and 'successful' characters as the ones who utilize this character trait the most effectively (3), it is probably the most important motif. By contrast, those who fail to exhibit cleverness do not overcome their hardships and tend to meet their demise. The two main protagonists, Odysseus and Penelope, display (4) Metis on (50) numerous occasions, for example, Odysseus' cunningly gets off of (40) the island of the Cyclopes and Penelope' attempts to delay marriage. In both of these instances the use of ingenuity led to their reunion, and ultimately their success. Simply put, those who display (6) cleverness are more likely (7) to attain their goals, and those such as Odysseus' crew, who fail to show (9) ingenuity, fair poorly, thus allowing Homer to move the plot (10) forward excellently through the use of this motif.
